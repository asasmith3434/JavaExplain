    <h1> Explanation A2-A5! </h1>
    <h2> A2</h2>
            <p> A2 we only wanted to find the mean quize score of penguin one. 
              <pre>
              var answer= d3.mean(classroom[0].quizes, getGrade)
              </pre>
           d3.mean is being used to give us a mean of an array of elements, and in this case the array of quize grades within
            the first penguin. getGrade previously was defined as the quiz grades, and gives the command to pull them.
    </p>
    <h2> A3</h2>
            <p> To solve A3 we wanted to find the mean of quize grades for an individual penguin, by creating a function. 
              Therefore, we created the code:
              <pre> var getBob= function(penguin)
    {
        return d3.mean(penguin.quizes,getGrade);
    }
        var answer= getBob(classroom[1]); </pre>
                Firstly, we needed to give a name to our function (getBob). The function, inside the brackets, takes 
                the means of the quize grades of all the penguins. Secondly, in the last line of code the second penguin needs
                to be called to individually find the mean of its quize grades by calling (classroom[1]).
            </p>
    <h2> A4 </h4>
<p> <pre> var answer= classroom.map(getBob); </pre>
For A4 we wanted the mean quiz score of each penguin individually, so an array of means. Therefore, by stating classroom map will
take all the elements within classroom, and getBob was previously defined as a function of all the penguins. In result, map takes
the arrays of classroom objects and transforms them through the function to create an array of defined number, or in this case
all of the means of each penguin into an array. 
</p>
<h2> A5 </h2> 
  <p> <pre> var getJo= d3.mean(classroom.map(getBob));
var answer= getJo;
 </pre>
    Now that we have the mean quize scores of all the penguins, A5 only wants us to find the mean of the array. Using d3.mean gives 
    us the mean of the array we found in A4. Calling is getJo was only to identify it inside the var answer=.
